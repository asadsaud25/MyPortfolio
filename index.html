        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 2nd-year BCA scholar at Aligarh Muslim University, Uttar Pradesh, with a strong passion for learning and a solid command of C language and Java, particularly in the field of Data Structures and Algorithms. My goal is to pursue a challenging career in Software Development, where I can leverage my knowledge and skills to achieve optimal results.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a dedicated student, I am constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge beyond the classroom. I find joy in exploring new technologies and programming concepts, and I'm always eager to take on new challenges in the world of software development.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to my academic pursuits, I also enjoy reading personality development books, as I believe in continuous self-improvement and personal growth.
